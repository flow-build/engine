## Run the project:

### On Docker:

To run tests on docker, you may use the command below:
```
docker-compose run -T app ./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

To setup the docker environment, you may run `docker-compose build` followed by `docker-compose up`.
Running `docker-compose up` will setup two containers (Application and Database Server) and run the migrations.

Once the commands above have been executed, you may run `docker exec -it workflow_app /bin/bash` to gain access to a bash inside the container of the Application. To run the tests, you may use the commands below.

To run tests with PostgreSQL database persistence:
```
npm run tests
```

To run tests with memory persistence:
```
npm run tests-memory
```

### On your localhost:

Run the commands below to setup your environment and run the tests to verify that your environment was correctly built.

```
psql -f scripts/sql/create_database.sql
npm install
npm run migrations
npm run tests
npm run tests-memory
```

## Running the examples:
First, install all the dependencies with `npm install`. The examples run with memory persistence option by default.

To run the examples from the root path of the project, you may run a command like the one below:

```
node examples/<example_name>.js
```
